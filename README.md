In this coursework, I estimated the cost of a one-off bearing housing, produced from raw materials and manufactued by standard machine tools, such as a mill, lathe, and bench drill.
Costs for machining, assembling, assembly, dimension, tolerance and surface finish for each step are included in the excel sheet, alongside diagrams produced in SolidWorks to represent material removed. 
A final drawing shows the tolerance and assembly of my bearing.
